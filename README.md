# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python

A simple command-line implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game, written in Python. This game allows the user to play against the computer, with the computerâ€™s choice being randomly generated.

## Features
- **Play Against Computer**: The player competes against the computer.
- **Choices**: The player and computer can choose from three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Winner Determination**: The winner is determined based on the following rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors.
  - Scissors beats Paper.
  - Paper beats Rock.
- **Tie**: If both the player and computer choose the same option, the game results in a tie.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (Recommended version: Python 3.6 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohithds/rock-paper-scissors.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd rock-paper-scissors
   ```

3. There are no external dependencies for this project, so you don't need to install any additional libraries. The game works with Python's built-in modules.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `rock_paper_scissors.py`:

   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```

2. You will be prompted to choose between **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.

3. The computer will also make its choice randomly.

4. The game will display the choices of both the player and the computer, and announce the winner or if it was a tie.

### Example:

```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Enter 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors': rock
Computer chose: paper
Computer wins!
```

## Error Handling

- The program checks if the player's input is valid (i.e., 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'). If the input is invalid, the user will be asked to try again.
